# DotNetAPICourse
 C# .NET with MS SQL Complete Beginner to Master 2025 Udemy Course files

This is the result from following the Udemy course on the title, so I'm only uploading the final result as the commit history would simply reflect what the course instructed us to do.

The API itself is not  live at the moment since I don't have a personal server to host it on.

The end result is a CRUD Application with a SQL Server DB which grew from executing SQL queries by passing the string directly from the code to using stored procedures. Both Entity Framework and Dapper were covered in the course, plus password management and basic authentication.

Please ignore the obvious or unnecessary comments in the code, this is meant to be a personal learning project, not something to be actually used.
